        String str="The Maximum Flow Problem [1] (see classical definition in Section 3) is of great importance in the scientific community as it allows for modeling, using directed graphs [2], crucial applications for society [1, 3]. Some of these applications are introduced below. The design of transportation routes on which the maximum number of passengers that can be moved between two stations per day is decided, the maximum number of people in the public transportation system, traffic on roads or other routes such as railways. In the maritime industry, companies must maintain inventories in different warehouses, as well as products between suppliers and end customers [4]. In the city waterworks where the amount of fluid to be transported in the pipelines is decided, in the electric power plants where the flow of current through the power grids needs to be managed, in the traffic on computer and telephone networks, and its applications in numerous other fields such as logistics, computer science, bioinformatics, security, engineering, operations research, logistics, and resource allocation [1, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Similarly, the Maximum Flow Problem is one of the classic problems of combinatorial optimization [1, 8, 9], from which a large number of optimization problems can be reduced to it [1, 9]: (i) disconnected routes and network connectivity; (ii) bipartite matching; (iii) circulations with upper and lower bounds; (iv) census tabulation (matrix rounding); (v) airline scheduling; (vi) image segmentation; (vii) project selection (maximum weight closure); and (viii) baseball elimination. This highlights the importance of the Maximum Flow Problem and its application and use in various instances, as most real-world problems involve maximizing or minimizing some measure to optimize some indicator [1, 9].\n" +
                   "Even being a very versatile tool in solving problems in 21st century society and a reference in the field of optimization and combinatorics, it is still intriguing to evaluate whether, given a Maximum Flow Problem, it is possible to estimate not only the maximum flow but all n-feasible maximum flows of the given problem. Solving this intrigue opens up new opportunities in the development of technologies for tackling problems of interest to society, such as planning evacuation strategies [10]. Where the development of an evacuation plan can involve the evaluation of an exorbitantly large number of evacuation routes depending on the particular scenario (e.g., buildings, sports fields, etc.); or, in the design of Very-Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) circuits, which commonly face problems that require determining the shortest interconnect routes of electronic circuits that optimize the flow of energy in the form of current [11, 12]. This can be complex given the combinatorial nature of the problem [13, 14]. Therefore, the objective of this project is to design a novel technology, i.e., algorithm, and its corresponding software tool prototype that allows for modeling, generating, and analyzing the behavior of different solutions to maximum flow problems at a conceptual level following the philosophy of bipartite graphs [15] and Computer-aided Engineering (CAE) tools [16, 17].";
